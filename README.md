# **README - Hierarchical Features Analysis**

## **Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook, **hierarchical_features.ipynb**, explores hierarchical feature representations in neural networks. The notebook includes methods for analyzing feature hierarchies, extracting relevant patterns, and visualizing structured representations.

## **Contents**
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Loads and processes the dataset for hierarchical feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implements methods for identifying hierarchical structures within data.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots and heatmaps to illustrate hierarchical feature relationships.
- **Model Analysis**: Examines the role of hierarchical features in predictive tasks.
- **Interpretability Methods**: Uses explainability techniques to understand hierarchical feature importance.

## **Requirements**
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch tensorflow
